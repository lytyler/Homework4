1.  If your working directory is myfolder/homework/, what relative path would you specify to get the file located at myfolder/MyData.csv?

    > ../MyData.csv

2.  What are the major benefits of using R projects?

    > The major benefits of using R projects are to keep an analysis together. Through the R project there is a shared working directory, workspace, history, and folder structure and source documents. This keeps everything necessary for the project together and easily shareable for collaboration, as long as file paths are relative.

3.  What is git and what is github?

    > Git is version control software that tracks changes committed to the files and allows multiple users to work on the same project. Github is a hosting service on the internet that allows us to do Git-based projects and share them widely.

4.  What are the two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame?

    > The two main differences between a tibble and a data frame are the specialized format in which tibbles are printed and that tibbles are not coerced to vectors when subsetting a single column using \[ \]. Tibbles are a specialized form of a dataset.

5.  Rewrite the following nested function call using BaseR’s chaining operator:

    arrange(filter(select(as_tibble(iris), starts_with("Petal"), Species), Petal.Length \< 1.55), Species)

> iris \|\> as.data.frame() \|\> select(starts_with("Petal"), Species) \|\> filter(Petal.Length \< 1.55) \|\> arrange(Species)
